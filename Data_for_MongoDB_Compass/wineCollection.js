      "Stoically self assured and classic, this charming sparkling rose wine is everything you look for from this style of wine. It’s fresh, calm and satisfyingly fizzy. Even Janis Robinson, the utmost of wine experts, recommends you enjoy it with an Ottolenghi Salad, or two! 'It was just perfect with the two Ottolenghi salads we had for supper that night: grilled carrots with coriander yogurt, and grilled courgette with feta and cascabel honey.' Janis Robinson",
